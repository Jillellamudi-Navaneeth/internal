# ðŸ“˜ Internal Marks Calculator â€“ College Assessment Tool

This project is a web-based **Internal Marks Calculator** tailored to the academic evaluation system used in our college. It helps compute internal marks for each subject based on two AATs (Assignment/Assessment Tests) and two Mid exams.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

To automate and simplify the internal marks calculation process for students and faculty, ensuring accurate and consistent evaluation based on institutional rules.

## ðŸ§® Calculation Logic

Each subject includes:

- **2 AATs** (out of 10 marks each)
- **2 Mid exams** (out of 35 marks each)

The internal marks are calculated as follows:

| Component       | Weightage | Rule                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AATs            | 10 marks  | Average of the two AAT scores                                        |
| Mid Exams       | 20 marks  | Higher mid score â†’ 15 marks<br>Lower mid score â†’ 5 marks             |
| **Total**       | **30 marks** | Sum of AAT average + 15 (higher mid) + 5 (lower mid)               |

### ðŸ§  Example

If a student scores:
- AAT1 = 8, AAT2 = 9 â†’ AAT Avg = 8.5
- Mid1 = 30, Mid2 = 25 â†’ Higher = 30 â†’ 15 marks, Lower = 25 â†’ 5 marks

**Internal Marks = 8.5 + 15 + 5 = 28.5**
